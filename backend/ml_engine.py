"""
ML-Based Urgency Triage Engine
==============================

Combines three signals into one urgency score (0-100):

1. Text severity classifier -- TF-IDF + Logistic Regression trained on a
   small seed dataset of request descriptions labelled by severity.
   In production this would be retrained on real, growing request logs;
   here it ships with a synthetic seed set so the prototype works
   out of the box.

2. Rule-based factors -- vulnerable-population flags (elderly, children,
   medical need) that a text model alone tends to under-weight.

3. Hotspot density -- DBSCAN clustering of open requests' coordinates,
   so a request inside a dense cluster of other requests (a likely
   disaster epicentre) is nudged up in priority.

final_score = 0.55 * text_severity + 0.30 * rule_score + 0.15 * hotspot_boost
